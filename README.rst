All the datasets in `./data` comes from http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/

Specifically, `big_10_football_directed.gml` is compiled by myself to test community detection for directed network. I combined data from http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/conferences/big-ten/2005-schedule.html and the original `football.gml` to define the edge directions.
